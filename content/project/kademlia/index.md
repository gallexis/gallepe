title: Kademlia
summary: "(2018) An attempt to implement the Kademlia protocol using the Go language.
          Kademlia is a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) protocol for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks and is mainly used in BitTorrent to find peers without relying on a tracker server.
          I first read the Kademlia protocol then, once implemented the appropriate data structures, started to fight with the un-connected UDP protocol (made me realize how much of a privilege it is to work with TCP)"
